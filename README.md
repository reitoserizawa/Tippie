<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>
I was born and raised in Japan and immigrated to the U.S. in December, 2021. In Japan, tipping can be seen as rude because they value dignity and respect much more than tipping. Though, since it is a common practice, I wanted to make an application that you can tip without letting them know.

<p>
In addition, I wanted to connect othwer people with good restaurants, as well as know about servers other than their service, so I made a review and profile system for both restaurants and servers.
